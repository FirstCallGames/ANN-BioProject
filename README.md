# Artificial Neural Network Project

## Overview
This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** using Python. The aim is to develop a neural network capable of learning and making predictions based on given datasets. The implementation includes training, testing, and evaluation of the model.

## Features
- Customizable architecture (layers, activation functions, etc.)
- Training with backpropagation and optimization techniques
- Support for multiple datasets
- Visualization of loss and accuracy

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (recommended: Python 3.8+). You can install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ArtificialNeuralNetwork.git
cd ArtificialNeuralNetwork
```

## Usage
### Running the Model
```bash
python TrainingAIModel.py
```

### Testing the Model
```bash
python ArtificialNeuralNetwork.py
```

## Configuration
Modify `config.json` to adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (choose one based on implementation)
- Matplotlib
